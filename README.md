Trevâ€™s Simple Photo App

I have tasked with creating something that shows what I can do but also has a little of me in it.
After too much thinking I decided that I wanted an easy way to catalogue images of my family in an online database. The functionality of inserting, updating and deleting the images would be provided by a Laravel application that would the expose these methods in a secure API that would allow other Applications to do different things to with the images and associated data.
